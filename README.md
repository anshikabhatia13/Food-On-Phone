# Food-On-Phone
This is a python based project, that aims at simplifying the restaurant system. It is a great way for customers to order and for the restaurant owners to keep track of the orders. This was primarily developed for a Coffe Shop as CoffeBot from where it was redesigned to organising the ordering at Juice Corner at our college IIT Ropar.
Customers can order running this program and the business owners will directly recieve the order at their Food On Phone Discord channel.

Still Working on its GUI
